## End-to-End ML Pipeline with Airflow, MLflow, Docker, and CI/CD

---

## 1. System Architecture
This project implements a fully containerized ML pipeline using:
- Apache Airflow (workflow orchestration)
- MLflow (experiment tracking & model registry)
- PostgreSQL (Airflow metadata DB)
- Redis (Celery broker)
- Docker Compose (container orchestration)
- GitHub Actions (CI-based model validation)

Pipeline tasks:
1. `preprocess_data`
2. `train_model`
3. `register_model`
DAG name: `train_pipeline`

## 2. How to Run the System
### 2.1 Start the System
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Verify containers:
docker compose ps

### 2.2 Access Airflow
Airflow UI:
http://localhost:8080

Default credentials:
username: airflow
password: airflow

Trigger DAG:
DAG: train_pipeline

Click "Trigger DAG"
Expected result:
All three tasks succeed

Retry enabled (if configured)

No manual intervention required

### 2.3 Access MLflow
MLflow UI:
http://localhost:5000

Expected:
Experiment: milestone3

Logged metrics (accuracy)
Parameter: C

Model artifact under model

Registered model: milestone3_model

Model Version 1 visible

## 3. Idempotency & Retry Strategy
DAG Idempotency

Training runs create new MLflow runs.

No destructive overwriting of previous models.

Re-triggering DAG does not corrupt previous runs.

Retry Strategy

Configured in Airflow default_args:

retries

retry_delay

Failures automatically retried.

## 4. Experiment Tracking Methodology
Tracked elements:
Hyperparameter: C

Metric: accuracy
Model artifact
Versioned model registry entry

Experiment name:
milestone3

Model registered as:
milestone3_model

Model versioning enables rollback capability.

## 5. Model Registry & Governance
Model lifecycle:
Training logs model

Model registered in MLflow Registry

Versioned storage

Production candidate selected based on accuracy

Rollback capability:
Previous model versions remain available

Can manually transition versions via MLflow UI

## 6. CI-Based Model Validation
GitHub Actions workflow:

.github/workflows/train_and_validate.yml

Triggered on:

Push to main branch

CI Steps:

Install dependencies

Run training script

Run model_validation.py

Validation rule:
accuracy >= 0.6 required

If validation fails:

Workflow exits with non-zero code

Merge blocked

## 7. Monitoring & Operational Notes
Potential risks:

Data drift

Metric degradation

Schema change

Model overfitting

Mitigation strategies:

Continuous retraining pipeline

MLflow metric monitoring

Version comparison

Airflow health checks

## 8. Reproducibility
Fully reproducible via:

docker compose up -d

All dependencies defined in:

requirements.txt

CI ensures automated verification.
